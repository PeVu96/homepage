## Description:
As you can see in title this is my first project. I wrote it about myself during the course at an online school **Youcode**. I'm so exited to start codding.

On the website you will learn more about me. I divided it into several parts:
1. Basic information
2. Interests
3. Education
4. Professional life
5. Dreams and plans for the future
6. Sport

I hope that my work will not bore you and you will read everything to the end. Good luck! :)
